# OSP-in-python
## Audience: Whoever interested in debugging openstack issues in python world. Currently we devided the topics into the following 3 sections which are easy to start with. Give us any good examples when troubleshooting the openstack issues using python skills.
## Sections (so far):
### 1. oslo_log module
We use oslo_log module to get more details you are interested. First we start with printing values into log files.
### 2. trace.py 
We can understand how things work by tracing the code path. trace.py is a good tool but needs some modifications. More details in the use-trace-py.md. 
### 3. pdb and winpdb
Sometimes we need to debug the code step by step and in this situation we need pdb (similar to gdb in C language) to trace the code. winpdb is a graphical tool.
